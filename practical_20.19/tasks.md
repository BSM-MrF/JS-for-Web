## ACTIVITY 20.18 ##

1. Create an array that stores the names of ten different films. Output each of these films, in turn, on a web page. Each film should be on a new line.
2. Store a list of image names in an array. Ask the user to choose an item from a dropdown menu. Depending on their choice, output one of the images (for example the first option in the drop-down box should output the image in index 0).
3. Create a web page with a text box and a button. Each time the user enters a number in the text box, and clicks the button, put the number into the next array index (you will need to keep track of the number of elements in the array using a global variable). Output the largest number and smallest number of those in the arrays.
